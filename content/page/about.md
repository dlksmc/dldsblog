Hi, I'm Dan!  I'm a data scientist who loves finding and understanding patterns.  With a light sprinkling of OCD.

I had always planned on blogging about data science, but had been too busy (or lazy?) until now.  Maybe I'll post
consistently, but probably not.

others.  Thanks, internet people!!  Some resources I used to create this site include:
