# Intro

The [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) craze has swept the nation. Are you tired of seeing annoying posts with weird characters like &#11036;&#129000;&#129001;&#11036;&#11036; from friends and strangers boasting that they've solved it in four tries, while you barely got it in six? You could always [cheat](https://gamertweak.com/wordle-answers/), but that wouldn't be ethical or satisfying.
